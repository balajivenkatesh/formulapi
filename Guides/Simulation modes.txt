At the moment there are two provided simulation scripts:
* "SimulationImages.py" - Useful for testing changes to the image processing using a directory of images
* "SimulationFull.py" - Useful for testing race behaviour, connects to the simulator written by computernerd486

The simulation scripts are effectively replacements for "Formula.py".
They work with the same scripts and settings as normal with some minor differences:
* They will run on a Raspberry Pi that does not have a ThunderBorg attached.
  * They may run on other computers as well, but we recommend testing with a Raspberry Pi for accuracy.
* The outputs for the motors and the LED are sent somewhere else, such as to the screen.
* They use an input other than the camera for the video feed.
* Some of the standard settings are overridden to allow for slight behaviour changes.

Below is an explanation of general debugging settings and each simulator in more detail.
For further help with the simulations please ask on the forum:
http://www.formulapi.com/forum

[General debugging settings]
These settings are useful for altering the output for debugging.
They are available in "Formula.py" as well, but we recommend sticking with the defaults as most of these options 
Most of these settings take effect every "Settings.fpsInterval" frames to prevent overloading the processor.
The default setting for this works out at once per second.

ImageProcessor.filePattern
* When using the writeImages or writeRawImages option this is where the files will be saved to.
* The format string should at a minimum include '%d' for the image number and '%s' for the description in that order.
* The file extension used determines the file type saved, e.g. '.jpg' saves a JPEG image.
* Default value in FormulaPi = './test-%05d-%s.jpg'

ImageProcessor.writeRawImages
* When True the incoming images to "StreamProcessor.ProcessImage" are saved.
* Default value in FormulaPi = False

ImageProcessor.writeImages
* When True writes any displayed images to file as well, most effective with "ImageProcessor.debugImages" set to True.
* Default value in FormulaPi = False

ImageProcessor.debugImages
* When True images are shown for various stages during the image processing, useful for debugging of the processing stages.
* This setting is very taxing on the processor, it typically causes the processing to run very slowly on a Pi Zero.
* Default value in FormulaPi = False

ImageProcessor.showProcessing
* When True the final points image is shown to the user.
* Default value in FormulaPi = False

ImageProcessor.showFps
* When True the measured FPS of the processing is printed to the screen at regular intervals.
* This value should be approximately the same as "Settings.frameRate" if the processing is keeping up.
* When using "SimulationImages.py" this value is typically inaccurate.
* Default value in FormulaPi = True

ImageProcessor.showUnknownPoints
* When True unidentified points are plotted as well, not just matched lane points.
* This only matters if "ImageProcessor.showProcessing" is True.
* Default value in FormulaPi = False

ImageProcessor.predatorView
* When True the red / green / blue / wall heat map will be displayed.
* This is a good way of quickly checking the colour tuning of the image processing.
* Default value in FormulaPi = False

ImageProcessor.scaleFinalImage
* When any value other than 1.0 the points view and heat map view will be resized by this value.
* Default value in FormulaPi = 1.0

ImageProcessor.scaleDebugImage
* When any value other than 1.0 any views not sized by "ImageProcessor.scaleFinalImage" will be resized by this value.
* Default value in FormulaPi = 1.0

ImageProcessor.dPlotY
* Sets how much height is used for the track angle line on the points view.
* This only matters if "ImageProcessor.showProcessing" is True.
* Positive values will draw up the image, negative values down the image.
* Default value in FormulaPi = -10

[SimulationImages.py]
This simulation is best suited towards checking the image processing.
It allows real images to be put through the whole system to see how the image processing behaves.
It typically runs slower than the real processing to allow diagnostic output to be generated.

There are two possible modes:
1. Pass a single image through the processing
2. Run through a directory of ".jpg" images for the camera input

The main simulation parameters towards the top of the file are:
* autoRun - True will use mode 2 (directory of images), False will use mode 1.
* fileIn - The file to use as input when in mode 1.
* autoPath - The directory to scan for images when in mode 2.
* autoDelay - The time in milliseconds to wait between images in mode 2, use 0 to wait for a key press.

This simulation overrides the "Settings.fpsInterval" value to 1 so that detailed output images are generated every frame instead of the default of once per second.
Motor speeds and LED values are printed to the screen.

[SimulationFull.py]
This simulation is best suited for testing the overall race logic and movement of the MonsterBorg.
It connects to the simulator written by computernerd486 to provide a testing setup without a MonsterBorg or track.
Performance varies depending on a few factors, ideally it will work just as well as the real running code with a good network connection.
We recommend running the simulator itself on another computer connected via a network.

There are two basic modes for this simulation:
1. Frame limited to represent how the real camera frame rate will be.
2. As fast as possible to allow for processing speed testing.

The main simulation parameters towards the top of the file are:
* simulationIP - The address of the machine running the simulator itself.
* simulationPort - The port number used by the simulator.
* frameLimiter - True will use mode 1 (camera frame rate maximum), False will use mode 2 (as fast as possible).

This simulation currently overrides these values:
* "Settings.maxPower" is replaced by "Settings.simulationDrivePower".
  This allows people to change the running speed in the simulation easily.
  Useful sometimes, but usually set to 1.0.
* "simulationLagFrames" is used to queue incoming images from the simulation.
  This allows for simulation of the lag time coming from the real camera.
  We have found this to be similar to reality when set to 2, but this will probably be different if the frame rate is changed.

Motor speeds and LED values are passed back to the simulator when updated.
They are also printed on screen for diagnostics.

Our recommended sequence for starting a simulation run is:
1. Load the simulation (Simulation.bat on Windows).
2. Press the Start button under Video Stream Settings.
3. Make sure the Off button is greyed out under Start Settings, if not press it.
4. Choose your Start Lane value.
5. Press Reset under Bot Simulation to place the MonsterBorg into the correct lane.
6. Run the SimulationFull.py script on the Raspberry Pi and wait until it has printed "WaitForGo()".
   After this it will start printing FPS readings on the default settings, they should be ~ 30.0.
   You will probably want to wait for about 10 seconds at this point for the script to be ready.
7. Press the Green button under StartSettings.
   The script should print "Lights: 1 - Green".
8. Press the Red button under StartSettings.
   The script should print "Lights: 2 - Red".
9. Press the Green button under StartSettings again.
   The script should print "Lights: 3 - Green".
   This will be followed by "Lights: GO".
   The MonsterBorg will begin the race at this point.
10. Finally press the Off button under StartSettings as soon as possible.
    With the green lights still on the script can get confused and reduce the green level in the image too much.
To start a new run:
* If the SimulationFull.py script is still running press CTRL+C and wait for it to finish.
  If it does not seem to stop even after waiting it can be forced to close like this:
  Press CTRL+Z.
  Enter the command: sudo killall python
  Enter the command: fg
  You should then see "Terminated" on the screen
* Start the sequence again from #3.
