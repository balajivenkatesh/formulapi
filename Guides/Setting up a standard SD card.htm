Please note that most of the installation steps will expect the Raspberry Pi to be connected to the internet.<br />
We recommend using a Raspberry Pi 3 as that is what will be fitted in the MonsterBorgs.<br />

<h2>Basic Raspbian image</h2>
The standard image is based on the official version of Raspbian.
We have tested using the 27th of May 2016 version: http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2016-05-31/
We recommend following the install guide <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">here</a>.

We also recommend expanding the filesystem using <code>raspi-config</code>:
<ol>
    <li>Enter the following command in a terminal: <code>sudo raspi-config</code></li>
    <li>Move down to option <code>1 Expand Filesystem</code> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
    <li>Move right until <code>Finish</code> is highlighted, then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
</ol>

<h2>Installing the ThunderBorg</h2>
First enable I2C using <code>raspi-config</code>:
<ol>
    <li>Enter the following command in a terminal: <code>sudo raspi-config</code></li>
    <li>Move down to option <code>8 Advanced Options</code> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
    <li>Move down to option <code>A7 I2C</code> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
    <li>Make sure <code>Yes</code> is highlighted and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
    <li>When the dialog says I2C is enabled press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
    <li>Make sure <code>Yes</code> is highlighted again and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
    <li>When the dialog says I2C will be loaded by default press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
    <li>Move right until <code>Finish</code> is highlighted, then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
</ol>
If the I2C option is not available simply proceed to the next step.<br />
<br />
To run through the automatic installer just use this one line in a terminal:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash">
bash &lt;(curl https://www.piborg.org/install-thunderborg.txt)
</pre>
If you would prefer to manually run through the steps use the commands below:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash">
mkdir ~/thunderborg
cd ~/thunderborg
wget http://www.piborg.org/downloads/thunderborg/examples.zip
unzip examples.zip
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
</pre>

<h2>Setting up the camera</h2>
After powering the Raspberry Pi you want to enable the camera functionality:<br />
<ol>
 <li>Enter the following command in a terminal: <code>sudo raspi-config</code></li>
 <li>Move down to option <code>5 Enable camera</code> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
 <li>Make right until <code>Enable</code> is highlighted and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
 <li>Move right until <code>Finish</code> is highlighted, then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
 <li>If asked if you would like to reboot, make sure <code>Yes</code> is highlighted, then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd></li>
 <li>Wait for the Raspberry Pi to restart</li>
</ol>
You can check the Raspberry Pi camera is attached and working by using the following command:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash">
raspistill -d
</pre>
If the camera is working you should see the image from the camera on the monitor for a few seconds.<br />
If it is not working or incorrectly connected you will get error messages instead.<br />
<br />
Next we want to install the Python library for talking to the camera:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash">
sudo apt-get -y install python-picamera
</pre>
<br />
As we want to do image processing we want the OpenCV libraries as well.<br />
This download is a bit larger and may take a while:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash">
sudo apt-get -y install libcv-dev libopencv-dev python-opencv
</pre>

<h2>Final notes</h2>
We will download and unzip your code into the <code>/home/pi/formulapi</code> directory.
We will add this line into <code>rc.local</code> to start the code:
<pre class="brush: bash">
sudo /home/pi/formulapi/Formula.py &amp;
</pre>

This means you will need a script called <code>Formula.py</code> the starting part of your code.
This will be how our standard example works, with <code>Formula.py</code> loading all of the other scripts.

If you wish to use a language other than Python you may, but it must be started from the command in <code>rc.local</code> listed above.
If your code will not run on our standard image you will need to provide a pre-setup micro SD card which will work with the Raspberry Pi 3 and will start up into a waiting for lights state on its own.
It will also need to access the <code>/colours.txt</code> file we write to the card and set the RGB values from the first line to the ThunderBorg LEDs (see the rules for more details).
