[Before starting]
Modifying the "ImageProcessor.py" script is typically for more advanced teams with more programming experience.

Before you make any changes we would recommend looking at the following:
* Our posts on how most of the processing works: http://www.formulapi.com/taxonomy/term/9
* The OpenCV tutorials if you are not familiar with OpenCV: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html
* Try running the standard code as-is to see what it already does.
  * You can turn on processing output images using the "Image processing debugging settings" section of "Formula.py" or the various "Simulation*.py" scripts depending on how the processing is running.

[Basic structure]
Inside "ImageProcessor.py" there are several parts responsible for different things:
* class ImageCapture: Manages the camera object and passes new frames to a free StreamProcessor instance.
* class StreamProcessor: Takes a raw camera frame and performs the entire image processing.
* class ControlLoop: Takes the output from the image processing and generates the desired motor speeds.
* Bits not in a class: A mixture of constants, settings, and helper functions.

[Simple tweaking]
If all you wish to do is make adjustments to the way the image processing works, you should probably start with "Settings.py" first.
The majority of these settings control exactly how the processing and control threads make their decisions.
The "Settings.py" file has detailed comments on the settings themselves, we would suggest reading through that script to get an idea how much control is provided.

[Areas for improvement]
There are some good candidates for improving the actual image processing that will be worth looking at first:
* Processing speed - From our testing anything which improves the frame rate of the processing makes the MonsterBorg follow the track better.
* Speed control - At the moment the speed is entirely controlled by the code in "Race.py", it does not use the camera data at all.
* Overtaking and traffic detection - The algorithm here is fairly crude, a more precise detection or overtaking logic will likely give better results.
* Harsh track angles - The current point sweeping logic works badly as the track approaches a 90 degree angle from the MonsterBorg, this is particularly obvious on the S curve.
* Track mapping - The code relies completely on the image processing, it could be improved if it has some kind of map to decide where it is roughly on the track.

[Breakdown of class ImageCapture]
This is a fairly simple thread which has only it's main run function.
It works using an already initialised cv2.VideoCapture object stored in Globals.capture.
When a new frame is ready it is given to the first thread which is ready to accept a new frame.
It uses a pool of available processing threads (usually only one on the Pi Zero) to decide which threads are available.
The StreamProcessor threads are responsible for returning to the pool when they are ready to accept a new frame.
There is only one of these threads running.
The initialisation will automatically start the thread.

[Breakdown of class StreamProcessor]
This thread is where the bulk of the processing happens.
It is intended to allow multiple copies to run at the same time:
* On a Pi Zero we suggest only running one copy.
* On a Pi 2 or 3 we suggest running four copies, one per core.
The initialisation will automatically start the thread unless told not to.

StreamProcessor.run - Waits for a new frame event, ends when the terminated flag is set to True.

StreamProcessor.ShowImage - Simple function to scale and display images, used for debugging only.

StreamProcessor.DrawCross - Draws a small cross on an image, used when generating the processing display.

StreamProcessor.DrawPoints - Wrapper around StreamProcessor.DrawCross to draw a list of points.

StreamProcessor.SweepLine - Used to scan a horizontal line in an image, returns lists of rising and falling positions.

StreamProcessor.EliminateMatches - Used to remove similar values from up to two lists given a target list to match.

StreamProcessor.FindMatches - Used to generate lists of matching points from up to three lists given a target list to match.

StreamProcessor.ProcessImage - Performs the bulk on the image processing.
Responsible for:
* Any override mode which affects the image processing.
* Detecting light changes.
* Checking if the MonsterBorg has flipped over.
* Testing if the MonsterBorg is stuck.
* Spotting the start line and maintaining the lap counter from it.
* Finding the lanes from the image.
* Detecting the MonsterBorg is driving the wrong way.
* Reducing the lanes to a set of points for analysis.
* Drawing most of the debugging displays if enabled.

StreamProcessor.SetSpeedFromLines - Takes a set of points and determines where the MonsterBorg is on the track.
Responsible for:
* Deciding which line(s) to make decisions based on.
* Handling situations where there is not enough data to process.
* Calculating the offset from the chosen lane (usually the closest).
* Calculating the angle the MonsterBorg is facing compared to the track.
* Calculating how much the track is bending around a corner.
* Drawing the final processing display if enabled.
* Setting an event for the ControlLoop thread to update motor speeds from the data.

[Breakdown of class ControlLoop]
This thread takes inputs from both the user code (in Race.py) and the image processing to determine the speeds to apply to the motors.
It uses PID loops on the various output date from StreamProcessor.SetSpeedFromLines to combine the readings into a single control signal.
The output from this control signal is put though a simple FIR filter to prevent sudden motor changes due to noise.
The override modes which affect the final motor output are handled here.
Finally the distance travelled around the current lap is calculated in this thread.
The initialisation will automatically start the thread unless told not to.

ControlLoop.run - Waits for an updated set of data from the image processing, ends when the terminated flag is set to True.

ControlLoop.Reset / __Reset__ - Sets the initial state of all the various filters and overrides, also disables the motors.

ControlLoop.SetDrive - Takes a speed and steering pair of levels and determines the appropriate speeds of the left and right motors.
It passes these speeds to Globals.MonsterMotors to perform the change.
Also calls ControlLoop.IncreaseDistance to calculate the distance travelled since the last speed setting.

ControlLoop.IncreaseDistance - Uses the previously set speed and steering along with the last and current offsets to determine how far the MonsterBorg moved since the last call.

ControlLoop.FirFilter - Performs a basic averaging of the last few speed and steering values before passing them to ControlLoop.SetDrive.

ControlLoop.PerformOverrides - Handles both detection and operation of override modes which involve the motor output or the point data.
This is called in ControlLoop.FirFilter before passing the filtered results to ControlLoop.SetDrive so that the overrides do not have an effect on the filtering.

ControlLoop.RunLoop - This performs a PID loop for each of the data outputs from the image processing.
The track offset loop works with the summed values of:
* The offset from the lane itself
* Adding lane offset for the lane we have computed from
* Subtracting the current user target lane (from Race.py)
* Subtracting its own automatic lane offset, used by the overtaking override
The track angle loop works directly from the gradient rather than a computed angle.
The track curvature loop works directly from the computed second-order gradient, the default example does not use this data.
All of the PID coefficients can be found in "Settings.py".
The final steering value is based on the sum of all three PID loop outputs.
The final speed is either off or the user set speed depending on the results from StreamProcessor.SetSpeedFromLines

[Making major changes]
If you are restructuring the code significantly there are a few things you will need to bear in mind.
* The threads are managed by "Formula.py", so any changes to the threading may need changes here
* The threads pass data between themselves and may look at values from other threads.
* Values used / written to the Globals module are used by multiple scripts.
