[The standard example]
The standard "Race.py" provided is quite boring.
All it does is:
1. Start logging what is happening
2. Wait for the lights
3. Wait until the 23 laps have been completed
4. Wait a few seconds to be sure we made it
5. Stop the logging
6. End the script

If you run with the standard code as-is then "Race.py" will do enough to complete the race.
What it lacks is any kind of intelligent decisions around the track.

[How can it be improved]
There are a whole load of functions this example does not yet use.
They can all be found here: http://www.formulapi.com/race-code/functions

We have some more detailed examples in the "RacePy samples" directory.

Probably the most important addition is changing the position we drive at around the track.
If you look at the "SimpleLap.py" lap example you can see how you can tell the processing where to try and drive.
The waypoint numbers for track #1 can be found here: http://www.formulapi.com/track-1/layout

There is a "BareMinimum.py" which is enough to run the standard code without changes:
* No logging
* No changes to lane at any point - always aims for the center of the track
* Does not stop, it will run until the battery gets flat!

In "SimpleLap.py" we have only included the most basic of race plans:
* No logging
* No logic based on the starting lane
* Does not wait after the final start line to be safe
* No special treatment for the very first corner of the race

We have a slightly more complete example in "BetterLap.py".
The basic strategy is the same, but there are more things going on now.

The differences are:
* The new version uses the logging
* It checks the starting lane when powered on
* There is code for the first straight and corner, allowing them to be different
* We have a short duration of aiming for the track center after waypoint 7 to prevent the MonsterBorg steering too hard
* We now have a short delay after the final start / finish crossing like the standard example to be sure we completed the lap

We also have a fairly detailed example, "DetailedLap.py".
This example makes a lot of changes an demonstrates how powerful these functions can be:
* We wait until the processing can see the track instead of just waiting for two seconds at the start
* We take a photo at the starting line :)
* We are now using the Speed function to slow the MonsterBorg down at certain points of the track
* We use a log more of the waypoints to get finer control
* We take a photo when we have crossed the finish line :)
* Instead of continuing to race at full speed for a few seconds we gradually slow down over roughly a second.

[What if I want more detailed positioning]
The provided samples do not use all of the functions available.
There are two basic alternatives to the waypoints.

Using WaitForDistance will allow you to specify a distance around the lap.
This can then be used for making changes between waypoints anywhere along the track.
The distance is based on how far the MonsterBorg would have travelled if it was driving perfectly on the center lane.

Using GetDistance will allow you to actually read the distance travelled and use it directly.
This is useful if you wish to fine-tune delays or write a mathematical function to control the position.
Be aware there are times the MonsterBorg can have the distance reduced, such as reversing after a crash.

For those who wish to use what the camera can see to help as well there are results from the camera processing code.
A detailed explanation of what is measured and the values returned can be found here:
http://www.formulapi.com/race-api/processing-results

[What if I want to do some image processing]
You can do additional image processing in "Race.py" if you would like.
To start with you can get the latest recorded camera frame from the GetLatestImage function.

There are also calls available to do the same processing the standard code does in chunks.
These mimic the standard processing so that they run independently.
There is a complete example of building the standard processing from these calls in "Run image processing.py"

[Things to be aware of]
The main script, "Formula.py" will look for and run a script called "Race.py" in the same directory.
* If this script is missing the standard code will never go into waiting for lights, so nothing will happen.
* Your code should replace the standard "Race.py" example.

The standard code is set to ignore the position set by "Race.py" and the camera feed for the initial dash to the first corner.
* This can be disabled by changing firstStraightOverride in "Settings.py" to False.
* When enabled it is best to aim for the current lane at the start to prevent a sudden position change when the initial dash finishes.

Sudden large changes to the target lane tend to cause the MonsterBorg to crash into a wall.
* Stepping via a halfway position for around a second when the change is two or more lanes seems to work reliably.
* Gradually changing the position over time is better, but requires more complex code.

You are sharing the Raspberry Pi's processing time with the image processing code
* The processing uses around 70% of the processor on a Raspberry Pi Zero to maintain the standard 5 frames per second processing rate.
* If the processing cannot keep up with the camera then the MonsterBorg movement may become sluggish or unreliable.
* Be careful if doing your own processing in "Race.py", it is easy to use a lot of processing time.
* Make sure your code calls one of the WaitFor* functions or time.sleep regularly to help ensure the processing runs at the correct rate.

If you want more control over the processing take a look at "Modifying ImageProcessor.py.txt" for more details.
