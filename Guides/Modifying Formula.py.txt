[General]
We generally expect that most teams will not have any need to alter "Formula.py" itself.

The "Formula.py" script is responsible for:
* Managing the threads which do the image processing.
* Managing the threads used for camera handling and motor control.
* Loading "Race.py" into a thread with the Race Code Functions available.
* Setting up the camera.
* Display of diagnostic images.
* Reloading "Settings.py" automatically if it is changed while running.
* Talking to the ThunderBorg for setting the real motor speeds and the LED.
* Cleaning up everything when the race is finished.

Typically these jobs are necessary to make everything work, but they will not really effect the performance of the MonsterBorg when racing.

[Restructuring]
If you are doing major restructuring of "ImageProcessor.py" or the scripts as a whole you may need to make changes to the thread management.
This is especially true if you are adding or removing threads compared to the standard example.

You may restructure the code however you like but:
* Our standard SD card image will start a script saved as "/home/pi/formulapi/Formula.py" - it must exist to be started.
* Your code must automatically start without user intervention.
* It must wait for the lights before starting the race.
* You need to set the LED to your assigned colour from "/colour.txt" when the MonsterBorg is ready to race so we know which MonsterBorg is which.
* If you need to install any programs / Python modules which are not part of the standard SD card image you will need to send us an SD card by mail.

[Other languages]
You may use a different programming language if you wish but:
* If you to install any programs / modules which are not part of the standard SD card image you will need to send us an SD card by mail.
* If uploading via FTP the entire program must be contained in the "/home/pi/formulapi" directory.
* Our standard SD card image will start a script saved as "/home/pi/formulapi/Formula.py" - it must exist to be started.

[Simulations]
One reason you may wish to modify "Formula.py" is to perform simulations.
Our Provided "Simulation*.py" scripts are in fact altered versions of "Formula.py".

The reason this is possible is that the function which control the output (MonsterLed and MonsterMotors) are in "Formula.py".
You can also replace the incoming images with a modified version of the ImageCapture class (see "SimulationFull.py") or by using manual image loading in the main code (see "SimulationImages.py").
